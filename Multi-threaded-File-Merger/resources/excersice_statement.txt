Problem 1- Multi-threaded File Merger
Objective:
Write a multi-threaded Java program that reads lines from multiple input text files and writes them to a single
 output text file. 
 
The program should merge the lines from the input files in a sorted order.
Requirements:
Input Files: The program should accept a list of file paths as input.
Output File: The program should write the sorted lines to a specified output file.
Concurrency: Use multiple threads to read from the input files concurrently.
So
Sorting: Ensure that the lines are merged in a sorted order in the output file.
Error Handling: Handle possible I/O exceptions and ensure that all resources are properly closed.
Example:
Given three input files:
file1.txt:
apple
Orange

file2.txt:
banana
Grape

file3.txt:
kiwi
lemon

The output file merged.txt should contain:
apple
banana
grape
kiwi
lemon
orange

Constraints:
Assume that each file can fit into memory.
Ensure thread safety when writing to the output file.


The sorting should be case-insensitive.
